            <ul>3. For a long time I could not find the strength to fully start programming. In my repeated attempts to start learning programming, I gained a little experience, but still did not understand how people move from simple tasks to creating full-fledged projects. Using all kinds of CMS, I managed to create sites for friends and my own entertainment, but this always seemed not enough. Through isolation, at last the aspiration was strengthened by time. My goal is to acquire programming skills up to the middle level.</ul>
            <ul>4. At this time i get some knowladges about php and css, cms Wordpress, cms Joomla</ul>
            <ul>5. Some code from codewars 7kyu <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/birthday-i-cake)">www.codewars.com/kata/birthday-i-cake</a></ul>
            <ul><code>function cake(x, y) {</br>
  y = y.split('');</br>
  let sum1 = 0;</br>
  let sum2 = 0;</br>
  var alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.split('');</br>
  for (let i = 0; i < y.length; i++) {</br>
    if (i % 2 == 0) {</br>
      let x = y[i].charCodeAt();</br>
      sum1 += x;</br>
    }</br>
    if (i % 2 != 0) {</br>
      let val = y[i].toLowerCase();</br>
      let z = alphabet.indexOf(val) + 1;</br>
      sum2 += z;</br>
    }</br>
  }</br>
  let sum = sum1 + sum2;</br>
  if (sum > x * 0.7) {</br>
    return 'Fire!';</br>
  }</br>
  return 'That was close!';</br>
}</br></code></ul>
